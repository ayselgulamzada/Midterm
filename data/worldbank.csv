UIS.NERA.AGM1,"Adjusted net enrolment rate, one year before the official primary entry age, both sexes (%)","The number of children of the age one year before the official entry age to primary education who participate in an organized learning programme expressed as a percentage of the total population of the same age. For more information, consult the UNESCO Institute of Statistics website: http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/","The number of children of the age one year before the official entry age to primary education who participate in an organized learning programme expressed as a percentage of the total population of the same age.

UIS.SAP.1.G1,"Population of the official entrance age to primary education, both sexes (number)",,"Population of the age-group theoretically corresponding to the official entrance age to primary education. The official entrance age is the age at which students would enter a given programme or level of education assuming they start at the official entrance age for the lowest level of education, study full-time throughout and progressed through the system without repeating or skipping a grade. The theoretical entrance age to a given programme or level is typically, but not always, the most common entrance age.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics,Population
UIS.NERT.1,"Total net enrolment rate, primary, both sexes (%)",,"Total number of students of the official age group for primary education who are enrolled in any level of education, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding population. Divide the total number of students in the official school age range for primary education who are enrolled in any level of education by the population of the same age group and multiply the result by 100. The difference between the total NER and the adjusted NER provides a measure of the proportion of children in the official relevant school age group who are enrolled in levels of education below the one intended for their age. The difference between the total NER and the adjusted NER for primary education is due to enrolment in pre-primary education. The total NER should be based on total enrolment of the official relevant school age group in any level of education for all types of schools and education institutions, including public, private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics,Primary
